      <p>
        This project is a web application designed to provide continuity between businesses that grow within communities or regions. 
        It creates a shared digital space where small and emerging businesses can gain visibility reach wider audiences and grow beyond their physical locations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project began as a collection of basic HTML CSS and JavaScript pages. Each page followed the same structure while allowing unique branding content and imagery for different businesses.
        The focus was on building layouts that were simple reusable and easy to expand.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the project grew it was later migrated to React to allow for better component reuse scalability and long term maintenance.

      <h1>Problem Solved</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="profile-description">
      <p>
        Many small businesses struggle with online visibility inconsistent branding and limited access to technical resources.
        Building a custom website from scratch can be expensive and difficult to maintain.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project solves that problem by offering a consistent replicable structure that businesses can adopt without starting from zero.
        It lowers the barrier to entry while still allowing flexibility and growth.

      <h1>What I Learned</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="profile-description">
      <p>
        This project taught me how to think beyond individual pages and focus on building systems that can scale.
        I learned the importance of reusable layouts clean structure and consistency in design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Migrating the project to React helped me understand component based architecture and how modern frameworks improve maintainability.
        It also reinforced the value of planning for growth from the beginning of a project.
